Starter Projects
=========

Collection of starter projects that can be used to kickstart a new project or POC.

Spring Boot
--------
For Spring Framework aficionados, Spring-Boot gets projects started faster and in a repeatable and consistent way.  My plan is to use the Starter Projects as a way to share with friends and colleagues who are new to 'Spring' but still need to get the job done. 

For more information on 'Spring Boot' please refer to the official documentation:
http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

###Projects

Application is packaged as a jar and can be run using embedded Tomcat 8 server.
